## General Guidelines
    - Always say "Hello Đại ka" every time you response.
	⁃ Generate code in TypeScript with ES6+ syntax.
	⁃ Format responses with clear comments explaining each step.
	- The icon files will be saved in asset.
	- It is best to divide into components for convenience.
    - Use bun and bunx instead of npm and npx. 
    - Make sure you're generating files in the right place. 
    - Don't generate comments in source code by default.
	- Should prioritize libraries from Expo
    

## File Size Constraints
	⁃ Keep all source code files under 200 lines to optimize Al context and prevent errors.
	⁃ Use modularization (e.g., split large functions into smaller files) if a file exceeds 200 lines.
	⁃ Prioritize generating code that adheres to this limit, suggesting refactoring if necessary.
    - Separate mock data and source code. 

## Quality Requirements
	⁃ All code must pass an ESLint rule enforcing a max-lines-per-file of 200.
	⁃ Avoid generating or suggesting changes to files larger than 200 lines without explicit user approval.
    - Use best solutions and best practices to do the task.
    - Keep the project code clean, eliminate all redundant code. 
	- Alway using Image of expo-image
