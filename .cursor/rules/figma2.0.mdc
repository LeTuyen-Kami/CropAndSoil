# MCP Development Workflow

## Using Figma MCP

- Follow the provided Figma link to analyze the design.

## Step 1: Analyze the Structure

- Break down the design into individual sections.
- Identify whether each section is a reusable component.
- If a component is reusable, check if it already exists in `app/components/common/README.md`.
  - If it exists, use the existing component.
  - If it does not exist, create a new component in `app/components/common` and update `app/components/common/README.md`.

## Step 2: Asset Management

- Check if icon exists in `app/assets/imagePath.ts` then use it.
- if not, using @expo/vector-icons.


## Step 3: Implement the Code

- Begin coding in the designated file as per the project structure.
- Follow best practices to ensure modularity and maintainability.
- Utilize the predefined components and assets for consistency.

### Notes:
- Always ensure components are reusable where possible to maintain a scalable codebase.
- Keep `README.md` updated to provide clear documentation for future reference.
- Maintain proper asset organization to avoid redundancy and improve accessibility.
- Using Nativewind for style
- Don't download any image from figma.
