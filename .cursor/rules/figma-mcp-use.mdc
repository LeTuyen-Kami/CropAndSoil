# MCP Development Workflow

## Using Figma MCP

- Follow the provided Figma link to analyze the design.

## Step 1: Analyze the Structure

- Break down the design into individual sections.
- Identify whether each section is a reusable component.
- If a component is reusable, check if it already exists in `app/component/common/README.md`.
  - If it exists, use the existing component.
  - If it does not exist, create a new component in `app/component/common` and update `app/component/common/README.md`.

## Step 2: Asset Management

- Identify any images or icons in the design, image alway save as png, icon can use svg.
- Download and organize assets as follows:
  - Store images in `app/assets/images`.
  - Store icons in `app/assets/icons`.
- Update `app/assets/imagePath.ts` to reflect the newly added assets, remmeber check if exists.

## Step 3: Implement the Code

- Begin coding in the designated file as per the project structure.
- Follow best practices to ensure modularity and maintainability.
- Utilize the predefined components and assets for consistency.

### Notes:
- Always ensure components are reusable where possible to maintain a scalable codebase.
- Keep `README.md` updated to provide clear documentation for future reference.
- Maintain proper asset organization to avoid redundancy and improve accessibility.
- Using Nativewind for style
